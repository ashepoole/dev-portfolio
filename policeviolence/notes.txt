Example 1:
Sinuon Pream was 37 years old when she was shot and tasered by police in Long Beach, California. 
BLACKOUT—NO BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE

Example 2:
Luke Smith was 15 years old when he was shot and tasered by police in Watsonville, California. 
VISIBLE—BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE

Syntax:
[Name] was [age] years old when [translated data: gender] was [manner of death] by police in [city], [translated data: state].
BACKGROUND COLOR: [body camera footage true or false?]

Concept 1:
The design picks random profiles every few seconds. Those with body camera footage are shown on a clearly contrasting background, while those without are shown on a dark grey background with black text that is intentionally hard to read.

Concept 2:
The code outputs a paragraph for every single person in the list, creating a nearly endlessly scrolling list of police killings.

Syntax: [Date]: [Name] was [age] years old when [translated data: gender] was [manner of death] by police in [city], [translated data: state].
